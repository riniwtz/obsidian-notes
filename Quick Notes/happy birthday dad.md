good afternoon daddy iwata,

i wish you a happy happy birthday!
you know that i always hope you the best in life,
i want to let you know that i'm also always doing my best every day,
i work hard and smart not just in my commitments,
but also on taking care of myself everyday,
to be physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually ready, to rule the world,
to fight off against my greatest enemy, which is myself,
from academics, to being a student-athlete here at DLSU,
i train every day just like in military just so i can build my own physique.

don't worry about me dad,
i also make sure to have proper rest,
to live my life to the fullest,
with endless opportunities,
and at the same time, responsibilities,
i'm doing this while i'm young,
because i won't be experiencing this when i grow older,
i'm always grateful for being alive in this world,
i've learned enough about life,
but i'm always willing to learn more each year i grow up,

i know how evil the world is,
the painful reality,
that's why i want to assure you,
that i'm doing all of this not just for myself,
but also for you, dad.

dad, you're one of my inspiration,
i know that i won't be seeing you at the moment,
and i don't want to expect,
it hurts and its painful,
i use that pain in hopes of seeing you again,
it won't be possible for now,
but i hope that someday, in another time,
i'll be in front of you, smiling and hugging you,
i miss you so much, dad.

and to all the mistakes that you have done from the past,
do know that i always forgive you,
past is past, and i'm just here to let you know that i love you so much.

i'm sorry if this message was written in this way,
i intended this just so i can express what i feel to you,
i know that you have a few months left,
but i'll do my best to catch up on you.

always take care dad,
i hope you're happy with your birthday,
your existence in life has always worth,
if ever you feel like no one loves you,
do know that i do.

i know your strong, dad,
please hold on for as long as possible,
but if ever the time comes,
that you no longer feel anything,
that you're already suffering,
it's okay to give up,
to choose peace.
to choose what the Lord has offered to you.

i'm always worried for how you've been felt,
through all this years of doing your own lifestyle,
your own routine that you're used to do,
from commuting alone, sleeping, eating, going to hospital, or going out with friends,
i understand that sometimes it's lonely, or it may really feel difficult because of your condition,
because of it, i want to say that i'm always proud of everything you have done, dad.
whether it may be for me, for you, for your friends, and for all.

i love you, dad,
i hope to see you when the time comes hopefully,
always take care,
happy birthday!


love,
from your only son, Rintaro Iwata
