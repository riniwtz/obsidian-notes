**Part #1: Sorting Algorithms**
- Complete the implementation of insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort.
- Implement additional 1 sorting algorithm of your choice other than insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and bubble sort.
- Do not modify the existing function / method headers.
- You are alloewd to define additional helper functions and make sure its a private method


**Part #2: Running the Algorithms**
- Use each sorting algorithm to sort each file from the data folder
- Make sure that when you call each sorting algorithm, you pass the original, unsorted list of
records, not a list that has already been sorted previously
- Verify that all sorting algorithms work correctly on given datasets
- Record execution time and empirical frequency count (number of steps) of each algorithm
- Use System.currentTimeMillis() function only to get the execution time.
- Record the "average" execution time.
- Bench algorithm multiple times (at least 5)
- When getting the empirical frequency count, make sure you are getting the actual number of steps performed by the algorithm for each dataset. You should have one count for every pair of algorithm and dataset.
- You may use additional datasets of comparative analysis, by generating your own data.


**Part #3: Writing the Report**
- Brief introduction of the project and an outline of the contents of the report
- List of sorting algorithms implemented with a concise description of each algorithm and its implementation
- Clear description of the process used in running the algorithms on the datasets, including the process used to verify the correctness of the results for the given data, and the process used to benchmark the execution times. Show supporting code.
- The execution times and frequency counts of the different algorithms on the given datasets. You can use tables and visualizations to convey the information as clearly as possible.
- A comparative analysis of the different algorithms across the different datasets, including theoretical basis that support the observed performance of the algorthms with respect to the datasets. Feel free to use additional datasets to validate the results or generate even more insights.
- Summary of findings and the group's learnings, insights, and realizations with respect to sorting algorithms after accomplishing this project.

- Beginning of the report should contain the list of members, as well as the group number.
- At the endo f the report, there should be a table detailing the contributions of each group member, as well as a References section if needed. References are to be cited using APA format.

- No required format for the report.
- Report is based on substance not the length or the number of pages.
- When writing, go directly to the point, avoid long blocks of text without substance.
- Make sure that it covers all the points enumerated above in a substantial manner.
- The report should have clear narrative. Its purpose is to convey your group's journey in doing the project and the learnings and insights you gained from it.
